## Project Goals
This project aims to provide a comprehensive suite of [romanization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization) systems
for most languages a dev might need to consider.

At the moment languages are being added in no particular order, so if there's a specific language or romanization system
you need for a project, [open an issue](https://github.com/zedseven/Romanization.NET/issues) and it may be given priority.

Please note that at the moment the public API is more likely to change than normal libraries, as it may need to evolve
as new languages are implemented (languages are often drastically different from one-another, and it is difficult to
cover all of them ahead of time before actually researching the language).

## Supported Languages & Documentation
At the moment Romanization.NET supports the following languages, with individual romanization systems supported for each:

- Chinese
- Greek
- Japanese
- Korean
- Russian
